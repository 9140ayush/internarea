## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Manual Testing Steps**

1. **Backend Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://internarea-h88w.onrender.com
   ```
   Expected: `"hello this is internshala backend"`

2. **User Sync Test**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://internarea-h88w.onrender.com/api/user/sync \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"firebaseUid":"test-123","name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com"}'
   ```
   Expected: `{"success": true, "user": {...}}`

3. **Profile Fetch Test**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://internarea-h88w.onrender.com/api/avatar/profile \
     -H "x-firebase-uid: test-123"
   ```
   Expected: `{"success": true, "user": {...}}`

4. **Frontend Testing**
   - [ ] Visit your deployed frontend
   - [ ] Login with Google OAuth
   - [ ] Navigate to profile page
   - [ ] Test profile image upload
   - [ ] Test DiceBear avatar generation
   - [ ] Test profile information editing
   - [ ] Verify real-time updates
   - [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

## 🚀 **Deployment Verification**

### **Backend (Render)**
- ✅ Server is running at `https://internarea-h88w.onrender.com`
- ✅ All API endpoints are accessible
- ✅ MongoDB connection is working
- ✅ User authentication is functional
- ✅ Image upload (Cloudinary/fallback) is working

### **Frontend (Your Platform)**
- ✅ All API calls point to deployed backend
- ✅ Firebase authentication is configured
- ✅ Real-time updates are working
- ✅ Error handling is implemented
- ✅ Toast notifications are functional

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **1. CORS Issues**
If you see CORS errors:
- Backend CORS is already configured
- Check that frontend is making requests to the correct URL

### **2. Authentication Issues**
If profile data doesn't load:
- Check Firebase configuration
- Verify user is logged in
- Check browser console for errors

### **3. Image Upload Issues**
If image upload fails:
- Cloudinary credentials may not be configured (fallback to base64)
- Check file size (max 5MB)
- Verify file format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

### **4. Database Issues**
If user data doesn't persist:
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify user sync is working
- Check backend logs for errors

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**

### **Responsive Design**
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify touch interactions
- [ ] Check button sizes
- [ ] Test image upload on mobile
- [ ] Verify modal dialogs work

### **Performance**
- [ ] Check loading times
- [ ] Verify image optimization
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Check memory usage

## 🔒 **Security Verification**

### **Backend Security**
- [ ] Authentication middleware is working
